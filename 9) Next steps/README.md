- 🚀 **Complete ECS Project** : build and deploy it first via ClickOps, then replicate using Terraform.  
- 🧩 **Share LinkedIn Updates** : document your progress on Docker, Terraform, and CI/CD modules.  
- 🧠 **Strengthen Fundamentals** : keep refining core areas like networking, Linux scripting, and cloud architecture.  
- 💬 **Reflect Weekly** : write short summaries on what you learned and challenges solved.  
- 🎯 **Plan Next Module** : explore Kubernetes or Monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana) after ECS.
