# 🧭 The DevOps Learning Journey  *(Nour's personal notes)*

Welcome to **the CI/CDiary**! This is my personal central hub for all notes, labs, and projects as I move from beginner to professional in DevOps, infrastructure, and cloud engineering.

This repo tracks (Almost) everything I’ve built, broken, debugged, and learned along the way. From foundational Linux skills to full-scale cloud deployments and automation.

## 🚀 Overview

> *"Truly The best way to learn DevOps isn’t to just watch, it’s to get stuck in straight away."*

✅ **Modules Completed:**
- Linux & Bash  
- Git & GitHub  
- Networking  
- Docker
