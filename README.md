# 🧭 The DevOps Learning Journey — *by Abdirahman Nour*

Welcome to my **DevOps Learning Repository** — my central hub for all notes, labs, and projects as I move from beginner to professional in DevOps, infrastructure, and cloud engineering.

This repo tracks (Almost) everything I’ve built, broken, debugged, and learned along the way. From foundational Linux skills to full-scale cloud deployments and automation.

## 🚀 Overview

> *"Truly The best way to learn DevOps isn’t to just watch, it’s to get stuck in straight away."*

✅ **Modules Completed:**
- Linux & Bash  
- Git & GitHub  
- Networking  
- Docker  
- AWS (EC2, VPC, ALB, CloudWatch)  
- Terraform (IaC + Cloud Init automation)

🧠 Every module includes assignments, projects, and automation scripts — all committed here for review and reference.  
💡 Currently exploring deeper topics in ECS, Terraform modules, and production-grade pipelines.
